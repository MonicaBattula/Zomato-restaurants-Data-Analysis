To work with this dataset, SQL is chosen as it can be used to extract and manipulate the data in various ways. Using SQL queries, we want to answer questions such as finding the top-rated restaurants in a specific city, the most popular cuisines in a particular location, and how does the price range of a restaurant affect its rating as a part of the analysis.
